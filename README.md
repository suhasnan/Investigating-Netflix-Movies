# Investigating-Netflix-Movies
today I made a data analysis project from the netflix data set, which includes the name of the film, actor, country of origin of production, genre, year of release, and duration.

you can practice it yourself, here I have provided the csv data set.

The conclusion that my data draws from the analysis is that every year film production is increasing and also the average duration of the film is between 100 - 150 minutes.
